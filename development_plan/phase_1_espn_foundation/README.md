# Phase 1: ESPN Foundation & Core Infrastructure

## Phase Overview
Establish the foundational infrastructure for the Rumbledore platform with a focus on ESPN Fantasy Football integration, local development environment, and core data architecture.

**Duration**: 8 weeks (4 sprints)  
**Risk Level**: Medium (External API dependency)  
**Priority**: Critical - All other phases depend on this foundation

## Objectives
1. Set up complete local development environment
2. Implement secure ESPN authentication and cookie management
3. Build robust data ingestion pipeline for real-time updates
4. Import and normalize historical league data
5. Establish core database schema with sandboxed architecture

## Sprints

### Sprint 1: Local Development Setup (Weeks 1-2)
**Focus**: Docker environment, database schema, development tooling
- Set up Docker Compose with PostgreSQL + pgvector + Redis
- Create initial database schema with sandboxed architecture
- Configure Next.js API routes structure
- Establish TypeScript types for all data models
- Set up testing framework and CI/CD pipeline

### Sprint 2: ESPN Authentication (Weeks 3-4)
**Focus**: Cookie management, browser extension, secure storage
- Build browser extension for cookie capture (Chrome/Safari)
- Implement cookie encryption/decryption service
- Create secure storage system in PostgreSQL
- Build validation and refresh logic
- Develop admin UI for credential management

### Sprint 3: Data Ingestion Pipeline (Weeks 5-6)
**Focus**: Real-time sync, data transformation, caching
- Implement ESPN API client with rate limiting
- Build data transformation and normalization layer
- Set up queue system for async processing
- Implement Redis caching strategy
- Create WebSocket infrastructure for live updates

### Sprint 4: Historical Data Import (Weeks 7-8)
**Focus**: Batch import, data validation, storage optimization
- Build batch import system for historical seasons
- Implement data deduplication and validation
- Create incremental sync strategy
- Develop progress tracking and resumability
- Optimize storage and create indexes

## Key Deliverables

### Infrastructure
- ✅ Docker-based development environment
- ✅ PostgreSQL with pgvector extension
- ✅ Redis caching layer
- ✅ Queue processing system

### ESPN Integration
- ✅ Browser extension for cookie capture
- ✅ Encrypted credential storage
- ✅ API client with rate limiting
- ✅ Real-time data synchronization

### Data Management
- ✅ Sandboxed database schema
- ✅ Historical data import tools
- ✅ Data validation system
- ✅ Caching strategy implementation

### Development Tools
- ✅ TypeScript type definitions
- ✅ Testing framework
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline
- ✅ Development documentation

## Technical Requirements

### System Requirements
- Node.js 20 LTS
- Docker & Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL 16 with pgvector
- Redis 7
- Chrome/Safari for extension testing

### External Dependencies
- ESPN Fantasy Football account for testing
- At least one active league for data

### Performance Targets
- ESPN sync: < 5 minutes for full league
- API response: < 200ms p95
- Historical import: < 30 minutes for 10 years
- Cache hit ratio: > 80%

## Architecture Decisions

### Database Design
- UUID primary keys for global uniqueness
- JSONB for flexible ESPN data storage
- Separate schemas for league isolation
- Materialized views for performance

### Security Approach
- AES-256 encryption for ESPN cookies
- Row-level security for data isolation
- Secure cookie transmission
- Audit logging for all data changes

### Caching Strategy
- Redis for hot data (current week)
- PostgreSQL for cold data (historical)
- 5-minute TTL for live data
- Infinite TTL for historical data

## Risk Mitigation

### ESPN API Changes
**Risk**: Unofficial API may change without notice
**Mitigation**: 
- Comprehensive error handling
- Fallback to cached data
- Version detection logic
- Manual override capabilities

### Cookie Expiration
**Risk**: ESPN cookies expire requiring re-authentication
**Mitigation**:
- Automatic refresh attempts
- User notifications for manual refresh
- Grace period with cached data
- Multiple account support

### Data Volume
**Risk**: Large leagues with extensive history may strain resources
**Mitigation**:
- Pagination for large datasets
- Incremental import strategies
- Data compression techniques
- Archival for old seasons

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Successfully import league data from ESPN
- [ ] Store and retrieve encrypted cookies
- [ ] Sync current week data in real-time
- [ ] Import 10 years of historical data
- [ ] Maintain data isolation between leagues

## Integration Points

### Downstream Dependencies
These components will be built in this phase:
- Database schema
- API structure
