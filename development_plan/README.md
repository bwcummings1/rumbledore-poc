# Rumbledore Development Plan

## Project Vision
Rumbledore is a comprehensive fantasy football platform that transforms how leagues experience their competition through ESPN integration, AI-driven content generation, and paper betting features. Built with a sandboxed architecture ensuring each league operates in its own isolated environment with dedicated storage, agents, and content pipelines.

## Core Architecture Principles

### 1. Sandboxed League Design
Each league is completely isolated with:
- Dedicated database namespace
- League-specific AI agents with persistent memory
- Private content generation pipeline
- Isolated betting pools and competitions
- Separate vector embeddings for semantic search

### 2. Two-Tier Content System
- **League Portal**: Sandboxed news/blogs specific to each league's history and personality
- **Platform Portal**: General NFL and fantasy football content accessible to all users

### 3. Local-First Development
- Complete local testing environment before external dependencies
- Docker-based PostgreSQL and Redis for development
- Mock data and API responses for offline development
- Gradual integration of external services

## Development Timeline

### Overview: 16 Sprints across 5 Phases (32 weeks / 8 months)

| Phase | Duration | Sprints | Focus Area |
|-------|----------|---------|------------|
| Phase 1 | 8 weeks | 1-4 | ESPN Foundation & Core Infrastructure |
| Phase 2 | 6 weeks | 5-7 | League Intelligence & Analytics |
| Phase 3 | 8 weeks | 8-11 | AI Content & Agent Architecture |
| Phase 4 | 6 weeks | 12-14 | Paper Betting System |
| Phase 5 | 4 weeks | 15-16 | Production & Scale |

- Betting settlement accuracy: 100%
- Mobile feature parity: 100%
- User session length: >10 minutes

## Development Principles

1. **Sandboxed by Design**: Every feature respects league isolation boundaries
2. **Local-First Testing**: All features testable without external services
3. **Mobile-Desktop Parity**: Equal functionality across all devices
4. **Data Accuracy**: League statistics must be 100% accurate and auditable
5. **AI Authenticity**: Generated content feels genuine to each league's culture
6. **Performance Baseline**: Consistent sub-200ms API responses
7. **Security First**: Encrypted sensitive data, secure API design
8. **Progressive Enhancement**: Features degrade gracefully
