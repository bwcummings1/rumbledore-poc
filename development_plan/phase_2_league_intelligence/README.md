# Phase 2: League Intelligence & Analytics

## Phase Overview
Build comprehensive league statistics, records tracking, and administrative tools on top of the ESPN data foundation. This phase transforms raw data into meaningful insights and provides tools for league management.

**Duration**: 6 weeks (3 sprints)  
**Risk Level**: Low (Building on established foundation)  
**Priority**: Critical - Required for AI content generation in Phase 3

## Objectives
1. Solve player and team identity resolution across seasons
2. Calculate and track comprehensive league statistics and records
3. Build administrative tools for league management
4. Create analytics engine for performance insights
5. Establish data quality and integrity systems

## Sprints

- Team continuity tracking through ownership changes
- Fuzzy matching algorithms for similar names
- Manual override interface for corrections
- Confidence scoring for automatic matches
- Audit trail for all identity mappings

### Sprint 6: Statistics Engine (Weeks 3-4)
**Focus**: Calculate and track all-time league records and statistics
- Historical records calculation (highest scores, longest streaks)
- Head-to-head matchup history
- Playoff and championship tracking
- Performance trends and analytics
- Materialized views for query performance
- Real-time statistics updates

### Sprint 7: Admin Portal (Weeks 5-6)
**Focus**: Complete administrative interface for league management

## Technical Requirements

### System Requirements
- PostgreSQL with advanced querying
- Redis for caching computed statistics
- React Admin dashboard components
- Background job processing for calculations

### Performance Targets
- Identity resolution: < 5 seconds per season
- Statistics calculation: < 10 seconds for 10 years
- Dashboard load time: < 2 seconds
- Real-time updates: < 100ms latency

### Data Requirements
- Phase 1 completed (ESPN data flowing)
- At least 2 seasons of historical data
- League member information
- Transaction history

## Architecture Decisions

### Identity Resolution Architecture
```
Raw Data → Normalization → Fuzzy Matching → Confidence Scoring → Manual Review → Final Mapping
                ↓                ↓                ↓                  ↓              ↓
            Name Variants    Similarity     Threshold Check     Admin UI      Database
```

### Statistics Architecture
```
Source Data → Calculation Engine → Materialized Views → Cache Layer → API
      ↓             ↓                     ↓                ↓           ↓
   Events      Background Jobs        PostgreSQL        Redis      GraphQL
```

### Admin Portal Architecture
- Server-side rendered for security
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Audit logging for all actions
- Real-time monitoring via WebSockets

## Risk Mitigation

### Data Quality Risks
**Risk**: Incorrect identity mapping corrupts statistics
**Mitigation**: 
- Confidence thresholds for automatic matching
- Manual review for low-confidence matches
- Audit trail for rollback capability
- Test mode for validation before commit

### Performance Risks
**Risk**: Statistics calculations slow with large datasets
**Mitigation**:
- Incremental calculation strategies
- Materialized views for common queries
- Caching layer for frequently accessed data
- Background processing for heavy calculations

### Security Risks
**Risk**: Admin portal exposes sensitive data
**Mitigation**:
- Role-based access control
- Audit logging for all actions
- Encrypted data transmission
- Session management with timeout
