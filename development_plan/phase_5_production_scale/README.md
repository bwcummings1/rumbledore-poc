# Phase 5: Production & Scale

## Phase Overview
Optimize the application for production deployment with performance improvements, monitoring, and scalability enhancements.

**Duration**: 4 weeks (2 sprints)  
**Risk Level**: Medium - Production deployment complexities  
**Priority**: Critical - Required for launch

## Objectives
1. Optimize application performance and bundle size
2. Implement comprehensive monitoring and observability
3. Set up CI/CD pipelines
4. Configure production infrastructure
5. Establish support and maintenance procedures

## Sprints

### Sprint 15: Optimization (Weeks 1-2)
**Focus**: Performance optimization, caching strategies, and bundle size reduction
- Database query optimization
- API response caching
- Frontend bundle splitting
- Image optimization
- Service worker implementation

### Sprint 16: Deployment (Weeks 3-4)
**Focus**: Production deployment, monitoring, and documentation
- CI/CD pipeline setup
- Production infrastructure
- Monitoring and alerting
- Documentation completion
- Launch preparation

## Key Deliverables

### Performance Optimization
- ✅ < 3s page load time
- ✅ < 100ms API response time (p95)
- ✅ < 500KB initial bundle
- ✅ 95+ Lighthouse score
- ✅ Efficient caching strategy

### Production Infrastructure
- ✅ Auto-scaling configuration
- ✅ Database replication
- ✅ CDN setup
- ✅ Backup strategies
- ✅ Disaster recovery plan

### Monitoring & Observability

## Technical Requirements

### Infrastructure Stack
- **Hosting**: Vercel/AWS
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with read replicas
- **Cache**: Redis cluster
- **CDN**: Cloudflare
- **Monitoring**: DataDog/New Relic

### Performance Targets
- Time to First Byte: < 200ms
- First Contentful Paint: < 1.5s
- Time to Interactive: < 3.5s
- API response time: < 100ms (p95)
- Uptime: 99.9%

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All performance targets met
- [ ] Zero critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] Monitoring operational
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Ready for 1000+ concurrent users
