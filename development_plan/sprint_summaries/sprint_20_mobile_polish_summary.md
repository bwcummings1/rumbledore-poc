## 🏗️ ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS

### Decision 1: Mobile-First Responsive Design
- **Context**: Need to support diverse device ecosystem
- **Decision**: Implement mobile-first with progressive enhancement
- **Rationale**: 60%+ users expected on mobile devices
- **Trade-offs**: More complex CSS but better mobile performance
- **Impact**: All future components must be mobile-first

### Decision 2: ResponsiveTable Pattern
- **Context**: Tables breaking on mobile screens
- **Decision**: Automatic card view switching based on viewport
- **Rationale**: Maintains data density on desktop, readability on mobile
- **Trade-offs**: Additional component complexity for flexibility
- **Impact**: Standard pattern for all data tables going forward

### Decision 3: Touch Target Guidelines
- **Context**: Small buttons hard to tap on mobile
- **Decision**: Enforce 44px minimum touch targets (iOS HIG)
- **Rationale**: Industry standard for accessibility
- **Trade-offs**: More space required on mobile layouts
- **Impact**: All interactive elements must meet this standard

### Decision 4: Skeleton Loading Strategy
- **Context**: Blank screens during data fetching
- **Decision**: Comprehensive skeleton components for all content types
- **Rationale**: Better perceived performance, reduced layout shift
- **Trade-offs**: Additional components to maintain
- **Impact**: All async content must have skeleton states

## 📝 HANDOFF NOTES

### For Next Developer
1. The webpack console error is a known Next.js 15 dev-mode issue - doesn't affect functionality
2. BankrollDisplay component needs to be created for betting dashboard
3. Test coverage should be increased from current ~65%
4. All responsive patterns are established - follow ResponsiveTable pattern for new tables
5. Mobile-first is mandatory - design for mobile, enhance for desktop

### Testing Instructions
1. Always test on actual mobile devices when possible
2. Use Chrome DevTools device emulation for quick checks
3. Test touch interactions with touch emulation enabled
4. Verify 44px minimum touch targets on all new components
5. Check loading states by throttling network in DevTools
