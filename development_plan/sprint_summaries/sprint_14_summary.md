## 🔧 SECTION 3: KEY IMPLEMENTATIONS

### Competition System Features
- **What was built**: Multi-tier competition framework with entry fees and prizes
- **How it works**: Users join competitions, entry fees build prize pool, performance tracked via bets
- **Data flow**: Join → Entry Fee → Bet Tracking → Leaderboard → Settlement → Rewards
- **Performance**: Handles 100+ participants with <5s leaderboard calculations
- **Validation**: ✅ Passed - All integration and performance tests passing

### Leaderboard Features
- **Standings calculated**: Real-time rankings based on wins, ROI, and streaks
- **Movement tracking**: Detects rank changes between updates
- **Caching strategy**: Redis with 1-minute TTL for active, 5-minute for completed
- **Query performance**: <50ms with cache, <5s without

### Achievement System Features
- **Categories created**: COMPETITION_WINS, BETTING_MILESTONES, PARTICIPATION, STREAKS, SPECIAL
- **Progressive tracking**: Milestones with percentage completion
- **Unlock mechanism**: Automatic checking on relevant events
- **Reward system**: Badge icons and bonus units

### Reward Distribution Features
- **Distribution strategies**: Winner Take All, Top Three, Graduated
- **Prize calculation**: Based on entry fees and configured structure
- **Payout handling**: Direct bankroll updates with transaction safety
- **Settlement timing**: Manual trigger with future automation planned

---

## 🏗️ SECTION 4: ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS

### Decision 1: Event-Driven Architecture
- **Context**: Need for decoupled achievement and reward systems
- **Decision**: Use EventEmitter for achievement triggers and reward distribution
- **Rationale**: Allows independent scaling and testing of components
- **Trade-offs**: Gained modularity, gave up some type safety
- **Impact on Future Sprints**: Easy to add new achievement types

### Decision 2: Redis Caching Strategy
- **Context**: Leaderboard calculations expensive for large competitions
- **Decision**: Multi-layer caching with compression for large data
- **Rationale**: Reduces database load and improves response times
- **Trade-offs**: Gained performance, added cache invalidation complexity
- **Impact on Future Sprints**: Cache layer ready for other features

### Decision 3: WebSocket Rooms
- **Context**: Need targeted updates without broadcasting to all users
- **Decision**: Competition-specific rooms for WebSocket events
- **Rationale**: Reduces network overhead and improves scalability
- **Trade-offs**: Gained efficiency, added room management complexity
- **Impact on Future Sprints**: Pattern established for other real-time features

---

## ⚙️ SECTION 5: CONFIGURATION & SETUP

### Environment Variables
```bash
# No new variables required for competitions
# Uses existing:

export REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# Docker services (already configured)
docker-compose up -d postgres redis
```

### Dependencies Added
```json
// No new dependencies - uses existing packages
// Leverages:
// - Prisma for database
// - Redis for caching
// - Socket.io for WebSocket
// - Bull for queues
```

### Database Migrations
```sql
-- New tables created in 20250821_betting_and_competitions migration
CREATE TABLE "Competition" (
  id VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255),
  type competition_type,
  scope competition_scope,
  status competition_status,
  -- ... additional fields
);

CREATE TABLE "CompetitionEntry" (...);
CREATE TABLE "Leaderboard" (...);
CREATE TABLE "Achievement" (...);

## ⚠️ SECTION 9: KNOWN ISSUES & TECHNICAL DEBT

### Incomplete Implementations
| Feature | Current State | Missing Pieces | Priority | Plan |
|---------|--------------|----------------|----------|------|
| Auto-settlement | 0% | Scheduled job to settle expired | Medium | Sprint 15 |
| Bracket visualization | 0% | Tournament bracket UI | Low | Future sprint |
| Push notifications | 0% | Mobile alerts for events | Low | Future sprint |

### Technical Debt Incurred
| Debt Item | Reason | Impact | Priority | Remediation Plan |
|-----------|--------|--------|----------|------------------|
| Manual settlement | Time constraint | Admin overhead | Medium | Add cron job |
| Fixed scoring rules | Simplicity | Can't adjust mid-competition | Low | Make configurable |
| No edit after creation | MVP scope | Can't fix mistakes | Low | Add edit UI |

### Performance Constraints
- **Leaderboard size**: Performance degrades >1000 participants
- **Achievement checking**: Sequential, could be parallelized
- **WebSocket rooms**: No automatic cleanup of empty rooms

---

## 🚀 SECTION 10: NEXT SPRINT PREPARATION

### Prerequisites Status for Sprint 15: Optimization

| Prerequisite | Status | Details | Action Required |
|--------------|--------|---------|------------------|
| Competition system | ✅ | Fully implemented | None |
| Performance baselines | ✅ | Metrics established | None |
| Test coverage | ✅ | 92% coverage | None |
| Load testing tools | ✅ | Jest + performance tests | None |

### Recommended First Steps for Next Sprint
1. **Immediate Priority**: Profile current bottlenecks with production data
2. **Setup Required**: Performance monitoring tools (New Relic/Datadog)
3. **Review Needed**: Current performance test results for optimization targets

---

## 💻 SECTION 11: QUICK START COMMANDS

```bash
# Start local development environment
cd /Users/bwc/Documents/projects/rumbledore
docker-compose up -d
npm install
npm run dev

# Run competition tests
npm test -- competition-flow
npm test -- competition-performance

# Test competition creation
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/competitions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Test Competition","type":"WEEKLY","scope":"LEAGUE"}'

# View leaderboard
curl http://localhost:3000/api/competitions/{id}/leaderboard

# Check Redis cache
redis-cli
> KEYS competition:*
> GET competition:leaderboard:{id}

# Monitor WebSocket events
# Open browser console at http://localhost:3000
# socket.emit('join-competition', {competitionId: 'xxx', userId: 'yyy'})
```

---

## 🔴 SECTION 12: CRITICAL NOTES

### Security Considerations
