## Architecture Decisions

### Agent Architecture
```
User Request → Router → Agent Selection → Context Loading → Tool Execution → Response Generation
                ↓           ↓                 ↓                ↓                    ↓
            Priority    Memory Retrieval   League Data    External APIs      Quality Check
```

### Memory System Architecture
```
Conversation → Embedding → Vector Store → Similarity Search → Context
      ↓           ↓            ↓               ↓                ↓

## Risk Mitigation

### Content Quality Risks
**Risk**: AI generates inappropriate or incorrect content
**Mitigation**:

### Cost Management Risks
**Risk**: API costs exceed budget with scale
**Mitigation**:
- Token usage monitoring
- Caching of common responses
- Progressive rollout
- Local model fallback
- Rate limiting per user

### Technical Complexity Risks
**Risk**: Agent orchestration becomes unmanageable
**Mitigation**:
- Clear agent boundaries
